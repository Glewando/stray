#' stray: A package for robust anomaly detection in data streams with concept drift
#'
#' This package is a modification of \code{\link[HDoutliers]{HDoutliers}} package. \code{HDoutliers} is a powerful algorithm for the
#' detection of anomalous observations in a dataset, which has (among other advantages) the ability to detect
#' clusters of outliers in multi-dimensional data without requiring a model of the typical behavior of the system.
#' However, it suffers from some limitations that affect its accuracy. In this package, we propose solutions to
#' the limitations of HDoutliers, and propose an extension of the algorithm to deal with data streams that exhibit
#' non-stationary behavior. The results show that our proposed algorithm improves the accuracy, and enables the
#' trade-off between false positives and negatives to be better balanced.
